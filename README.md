# Getting Started with Angular: Your First App
I named this app : **angular-oneapp-store**

> This app is help you understand how angular works and if you are new to angular. 

You can find the link to their official docs [Getting Started with Angular: Your First App](https://angular.io/start). 

## NOTE : 
* You do not have to create this app locally, you can create an Angular project on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/).
* Then you can download it locally after developing it on Stackblitz. 
* To install the dependencies, you just have to run `npm install` or `npm i`.
* `cd` into the project directory by using `cd <project-name>`. 
* Next thing to do is to run `ng serve` and you should see your project running on port `http://localhost:4200/`. If this port is taken probably because you have other project using that port, you should run `ng serve --port <name-of-the-port-you-want>`
