# Getting Started with Angular: My First App

I named this app : **angular-oneapp-store**

> This app is help you understand how angular works and if you are new to angular.

You can find the link to their official docs [Getting Started with Angular: Your First App](https://angular.io/start).

## NOTE :

- You do not have to create this app locally, you can create an Angular project on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/).
- Then you can download it locally after developing it on Stackblitz.
- To install the dependencies, you just have to run `npm install` or `npm i`.
- `cd` into the project directory by using `cd <project-name>`.
- Next thing to do is to run `ng serve` and you should see your project running on port `http://localhost:4200/`. If this port is taken probably because you have other project using that port, you should run `ng serve --port <name-of-the-port-you-want>`

# AngularOneappStore

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
